      <p>
        She needs to cut all her lose ends
Living through winter that never ends
Now is the time to realize
That he was never really nice

Her bleeding eyes
Through all those lies
But she says last chance never dies

Bleeding eyes
Through all those lies
But she says last chance never dies

It is a hard fight
To do something right
Rain is pouring down on her road
She needs to change
But it feels too strange
So she rather wears a coat

She's on the wrong point of angry bullet
Where's the luck she used to have?
Never ending losing streak
His final actions made her weak

Her bleeding eyes
Through all those lies
But she says last chance never dies

Her bleeding eyes
Through all those lies
But she says last chance never dies

It is a hard fight
To do something right
Rain is pouring down on her road
She needs to change
But it feels too strange
So she rather wears a coat

They say it's size that matters
It was the size of his big heart
He changes moods like weather
He wasn't like that from the start
I think she deserves better
It's time for her to be smart
Better climb up that ladder
Who would say it would be so hard?

It is a hard fight
To do something right
Rain is pouring down on her road
She needs to change
But it feels too strange
So she rather wears a coat

It is a hard fight
To do some things right
Rain is pouring down on her road
She needs to change
But it feels too strange
So she rather wears a coat
