      <p>
        Betrayed with a broken heart
Bottom's the best place to start
Sometimes it's best to try again

Pushed back but never last
Good thing I always ran fast
Hope will always be my best friend

Sometimes we're shattered
Almost like broken glass
Embracing the pain
We rise

Don't look back and move fast!
What happened should stay in the past
It's the only way to stay sane
Always try to have a blast!
Cause any day could be your last
You might not get that chance again

Stranded and left alone
You seek friends, but nobody's home
Just you and voices in your head

What would be and what could be
That never helped anyone
Otherwise you are just walking dead

Sometimes we're shattered
Almost like broken glass
Embracing the pain
We rise

Don't look back and move fast!
What happened should stay in the past
It's the only way to stay sane
Always try to have a blast!
Cause any day could be your last
You might not get that chance again

Sometimes we're shattered
Almost like broken glass
Embracing the pain
We rise

Don't look back and move fast!
What happened should stay in the past
It's the only way to stay sane
Always try to have a blast!
Cause any day could be your last
You might not get that chance again
