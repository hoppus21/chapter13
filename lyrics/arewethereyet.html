      <p>
        Please tell me is this right that people only hate each other?
Nothing is nobody's business
Everybody is like "so whatever"
Take a look and you will see
Why you have to try
We were given right to live
Let's give this right to our children

Soon enough the real nightmares will come true and nobody cares

Please tell me we're not already dead
We have to live our life instead
I'm not the one who's standing next to you destroying your world
Please tell me are we there yet?

Who do you think you are?
Looking at me like you know me
I don't love you, I don't hate you
Go away I just can't stand you
Take a look and you will see
There's nothing wrong with me
I can do what you can do
Three times more, even better

Soon enough the real nightmares will come true and nobody cares

Please tell me we're not already dead
We have to live our life instead
I'm not the one who's standing next to you destroying your world
Please tell me are we there yet?

Please tell me we're not already dead
We have to live our life instead
I'm not the one who's standing next to you destroying your world
Please tell me are we there yet?
