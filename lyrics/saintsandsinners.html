      <p>
        Time's up
Even if you all deny that
The time has come and
I'm not
Ready to be gone
But time will tell
We've got
Everything right here
And still not
Use it well
Now it's our last shot
Deliver us from evil
We're going to hell

(Right)

Will you do a good deed?
Or just sit and watch me bleed?
We're different but still the same
You pray, seeking to absolve your blame
With words, claiming virtue, a shallow game
The maker doesn't even know your name
(What?)

This isn't going too well
We're surely heading to hell
At least I got my own soul to sell

Time's up
Even if you all deny that
The time has come
And I'm not
Ready to be gone
But time will tell
We've got
Everything right here
And still not use it well
Now it's our last shot
We're going to hell

In dark corners, we find our fame
Trading morals for fleeting acclaim
Lost in the dance of saints and sinners
Where whispers drown out the winners

Will you rise or fall from grace?
In this game, there's no safe place
We've got now only ourselves to blame
But the debt grows with each passing day

Time's up
Even if you all deny that
The time has come
And I'm not
Ready to be gone
But time will tell
We've got
Everything right here
And still not use it well
Now it's our last shot
We're going to hell

This spiral, it pulls us down
In the end, will we wear the crown?
But in this darkness, a flicker of light
A chance to choose, to make things right
To make things right
