      <p>
        Once we were inseparable, love like a fire
Now we're drifting apart, losing desire
I tried to build us a world so divine
But the cracks are showing, love's on the line

I gave you the stars, the moon, and the sky
But nothing I do seems to keep us alive
I promised you heaven, tried to make it real
Now we're lost in this loop
Yeah
How do you feel?

We've got our problems
I know it's been tough
Baby, you're giving up
And it's tearing me up
No matter what I do
It's still not enough
I'll bring you heaven
But you call my bluff

I see the distance in your weary eyes
Love's turning cold, under stormy skies
I built us a castle, a place to call home
But you wander the halls, feeling alone

I gave you my heart, my soul, my all
Yet the walls are crumbling, starting to fall
I promised you heaven, a life so sweet
Now I'm left standing on broken streets

We've got our problems
I know it's been tough
Baby, you're giving up
And it's tearing me up
No matter what I do
It's still not enough
I'll bring you heaven
But you call my bluff

Can we find our way back to the start?
Heal the wounds, mend the broken parts
I'm reaching out, don't let us fade
In this heaven I made, let love invade

We've got our problems
I know it's been tough
Baby, you're giving up
And it's tearing me up
No matter what I do
It's still not enough
I'll bring you heaven
But you call my bluff

In this heaven I made
I see your face
A love that's slipping
Leaving empty space
I'll fight for us
Through storm and strife
I'll bring you heaven
To save our life
