      <p>
        Why does it always go so far?
We're human
And then we
Abandon everything we are
Do things that leave a scar
First spark and good emotion
Then cut, promises broken
Sometimes the ones you think the best
Are worst by far

The world is so vast
Temptation, temptation
You'll burn too fast
And adjust to the situation
These times are when
We're scared to trust again
But hope dies

Last times I saw you
Your body was here
But soul did somehow disappear
The first time time it happens
We almost shed a tear
The next time we're never really here

We always tell the world there's nothing wrong
We play this game until everything we ever loved is gone

The world is so vast
Temptation, temptation
You'll burn too fast
And adjust to the situation
These times are when
We're scared to trust again
But hope dies

Last times I saw you
Your body was here
But soul did somehow disappear
The first time time it happens
We almost shed a tear
The next time we're never really here

All the bridges we burn (to ashes!)
Relationships we turn (as time passes!)
No more trust to earn (all dismissed)
I guess we'll never learn (what's amiss?)

And all bonds we break (and shatter!)
With all the lies we fake (hearts battered!)
The faith that we forsake (it mattered!)
Is more than we can take

The longer we are here
the less do we trust
Im here for you but you never ask
Our egos are sometimes
More than we can grasp
We hold on because hope dies last

Life goes fast
We must outlast
because hope dies last
