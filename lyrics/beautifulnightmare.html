      <p>
        I woke up today with a smile on my face
Dreaming of your touch, your warm embrace
You're my sunshine, my morning dew
Every little thing reminds me of you

I wanna be your hero, your shining knight
The one who holds you close every single night
You stole my heart, made it skip a beat
With every little kiss, you made my life complete

Oh, love so sweet like a summer breeze
With you, my darling, time just seems to freeze
In your eyes, I see my future so bright
Hold me tight, let's dance through the night

But then came the storm, dark clouds rolled in
Your love turned cold, sharp as a pin
You took my heart, chewed it up, spit it out
Left me standing here, filled with doubt

I thought you were my angel, my better part
Turns out you were the dagger, twisted in my heart
You played it well, put on quite the show
Now I see the truth, you're just my foe

Oh, love so sour, like a bitter pill
You made me laugh, then you made me ill
In your lies, I see nothing sincere
I wanted love, but there's nothing here

So here's to the memories, the laughs, the tears
To the crazy ride we had through the years
I gave you my heart, and you tore it apart
But now I'm picking up the pieces, making a new start

Oh, love so twisted, like a carnival ride
You took me high, then tossed me aside
In your wake, I found my strength and might
Goodbye to you, I'll be alright

Oh, love so sour, like a bitter pill
You made me laugh, then you made me ill
In your lies, I see nothing sincere
I wanted love, but there's nothing here
