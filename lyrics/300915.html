      <p>
        Right then when the phone rang
I knew at that moment
I knew something was wrong
I knew it all along
I'd wish it was a dream
Nothing would be as it seems
Why would anybody call?
At this hour at all

I am not a religious man
But that doesn't mean I don't give a damn
You're the one that I can thank that I am who I am
And even if the skies now are grey now
I know deep inside that it's not too late
This will be not your fate
It simply can't be too late

Whatever I should say
Whatever I should do
I'd do it all to make this right
I don't wanna let you go
Can't walk this earth alone
Please hold on
Don't leave me tonight

Echoes in the air
The silence screams louder
Every breath brings a new scare
A desperate prayer

The hands on the clock
Ticking out of sync
As the unknown unfolds
Like a darkened link
Scared and all alone
With a destiny to rethink
Without you the house feels so cold
Thinking about all the words that are left untold
All I want is scream
But my breath is on hold

Whatever I should say
Whatever I should do
I'd do It all to make this right
I don't wanna let you go
Can't walk this earth alone
Please hold on
Don't leave me tonight

Whatever I should say
Whatever I should do
I'd do It all to make this right
I don't wanna let you go
Can't walk this earth alone
Please hold on
Don't leave me tonight
