      <p>
        They were happy, hand in hand
Dancing to their favorite band
But he heard whispers late one night
They said she kissed another
Under the moonlight

He believed the lie
It poisoned his mind
Thought of her betrayal
Left him blind
He couldn't see the truth
Couldn't see the light
He went out seeking solace
In the dead of night

She cheated first, or so he thought
So he found another, in his distraught
Now they're both broken
Hearts turned to stone
All because of a lie, they're left alone

She found out, her tears were real
In her eyes, the pain he couldn't conceal
She packed her bags, walked out the door
And sought revenge on the dance floor

She found strangers
Took them to bed
Tried to forget the things he said
In every embrace
A part of her died
Consumed by heartache
No place to hide

He cheated back, and she did too
Their love was lost, they both knew
Now they're both broken
Hearts turned to stone
All because of a lie, they're left alone

Two lives ruined
Two souls adrift
Love turned to ashes
With every rift
Once they were whole
Now they're just shards
Living in darkness
With broken hearts

Now they wander
Empty and cold
No love story left to be told
Destroyed by deceit
And jealous rage
Trapped in misery
Like a cage

He cheated back, and she did too
Their love was lost, they both knew
Now they're both broken
Hearts turned to stone
All because of a lie, they're left alone

In the end, it's just regret
Two lives shattered, they can't forget
All because of a lie, they both believed
Now love's just a ghost, that never leaves
