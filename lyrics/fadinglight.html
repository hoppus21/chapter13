      <p>
        I tried to wonder about that fading light
That's moving so slowly just out of my sight
You loved me yesterday,
you hate me tonight
Tomorrow it'll be over, then another fight

I am confused
Sometimes I don't see where it's coming from
Almost feel abused
By all the words that make my brain feel numb
I am alive
I know for sure because I still feel pain
Find the truth in lies
Well
After this I'll never be the same

Cause
Every night with you
I see we're changing
Is what we said still true?
Or not at all?

I tried to wonder about that fading light
That's moving so slowly just out of my sight
You loved me yesterday,
you hate me tonight
Tomorrow it'll be over, then another fight

I'm torn apart
My heart is divided, emotions run deep
Not sure where to start
The wounds we inflicted are something we'll keep

Cause
Every night with you
I see we're changing
Words are dark, heart is blue
Who will take the fall?

I tried to wonder about that fading light
That's moving so slowly just out of my sight
You loved me yesterday,
you hate me tonight
Tomorrow it'll be over, then another fight

And the poisons you've told me
And the cries that I hold in me
I just want you to hold me
Why won't you ever hold me?

And the poisons you've told me
And the cries that I hold in me
I just want you to hold me
Why won't you ever hold me?

I tried to wonder about that fading light
That's moving so slowly just out of my sight
You loved me yesterday,
you hate me tonight
Tomorrow it'll be over, then another fight

I tried to wonder about that fading light
(I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried)
That's moving so slowly just out of my sight
You loved me yesterday,
you hate me tonight
Tomorrow it'll be over, then another fight
I tried
