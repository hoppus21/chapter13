      <p>
        Back then when you left me alone
I have never felt so far from home

The bitter bulge that's in my throat
Every light step on this darkened road

I never thought of going away
Never thought you don't want me to stay
Long time ago, yet still like today

I am sure not pleading
Long time has passed
We did move on
My heart is still beating
Now that you're gone

If you've ever seen
The star falling down from the sky
Did you wonder how am I?
Did it ever cross your mind?
You're deceiving
and my heart's still bleeding
And I don't wanna play the victim card
But you never told me why

They were telling me I should stay strong
Did you too have hard time to move on?

I never thought of going away
Never thought you don't want me to stay
Long time ago, yet still like today

I am sure not pleading
Couldn't be more glad of walking away
My heart is still beating
What's more to say?

If you've ever seen
The star falling down from the sky
Did you wonder how am I?
Did it ever cross your mind?
You're deceiving
And my heart's still bleeding
And I don't wanna play the victim card
But you never told me why

All the memories are fading away
I don't want them to stay

On the ground barely breathing
But my heart is still beating
Left all wounded and bleeding
But my heart is still beating

If you've ever seen
The star falling down from the sky
Did you wonder how am I?
Did it ever cross your mind?
You're deceiving, and my heart's still bleeding
And I don't wanna play the victim card
But you never told me why

Back then when you left me alone
I have never felt so far from home
