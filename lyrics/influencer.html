        She's got a thousand selfies on her phone and
Perfect angles, never a frown shown
Living life through an Instagram lens
Filters and hashtags, pretending it's trends

She thinks everyone's obsessed with her feed
But it's just algorithms, that's the key
Counting likes like they're diamonds in hand
In her world, she's the queen of the land

Oh, influencer, what a show
Don't you know it's all for show?
Likes and comments, validation galore
But reality's knocking at your door

Oh, influencer, what a show
Don't you know it's all for show?
Likes and comments, validation galore
But reality's knocking at your door

She posts every meal and every pose
Product placements from head to toes
Life's a highlight reel, every day
But behind the screen, it's all in disarray

She believes she's changing lives with each post
But it's just sponsored content, utmost
Lost in a sea of followers' dreams
In her bubble, nothing's as it seems

Oh, influencer, what a ride
Living life with filters applied
Caught in a loop of likes and shares
Is anyone real out there?

Oh, influencer, what a ride
Living life with filters applied
Caught in a loop of likes and shares
Is anyone real out there?

Hello sweeties, we just hit a milestone: 500 subscribers! Thank you all for your amazing support!

Hey everyone, don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more amazing content!

Every day's a brand new post
Every day's a brand new post
Every day's a brand new post
But deep down, insecurity grows

Oh, influencer, take a break
From the fame that's oh so fake
Step out from the virtual haze
And see beyond the social craze

Oh, influencer, it's time to see
Reality's not on your feed
You're more than filters and likes
Take off your mask and live your life
