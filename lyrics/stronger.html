      <p>
        You think it's fun for me this way
Be humiliated and laughed
I used to feel that every day
Then I learned to adapt

And what if I'm still seething
What if my thoughts come screaming
What if the evil near me
Takes it all away
I look through blood in my eyes
Stop hiding in my disguise
You'll never gonna fool me with your bold lies
I'll never gonna let you bring me down

Cause I'm stronger
I'm more strong than I show
I'll survive every blow
I'm more strong than you'll ever know
Stronger
Whatever life throws
Being down and being low
Is nothing I don't know

You tell me everything is lost
When your world comes crashing down
It doesn't matter what it costs
You're gonna turn it around

And what if I'm still seething
What if my thoughts come screaming
What if the evil near me
Takes it all away
I look through blood in my eyes
Stop hiding in my disguise
You'll never gonna fool me with your bold lies
I'll never gonna let you bring me down

Cause you're stronger
More than you show
You'll survive every blow
You're more strong than they'll ever know
Stronger
Whatever life throws
Being down and being low
Is nothing you don't know

Cause you're stronger
More than you show
You'll survive every blow
You're more strong than they'll ever know
Stronger
Whatever life throws
Being down and being low
Is nothing you don't know
