      <p>
        Life changed, it hit me fast
Suddenly, I couldn't live in the past
World was testing my trust
Some people simply didn't last
Had dreams once, now I've got bills
Climbing up hills, strengthening my will
Friends turned cold, felt the chill
But I kept moving, pushing still

I had to grow up quick, and take the reins
Had to see through the smiles
And had to feel the pains
After broken promises, trust was in chains
No I'm not the one who blames
But there's still a part of me that remains


Even if the sky itself gets torn
I'll try to find my way home
Through the darkest times where hope is born
Even if I have to go it alone
Through the rain
Through the pain
Afterwards I've never been the same
It's hard to find the place where I belong
Since the man I was is gone


Changed inside, it's been a ride
Lost innocence, but opened my eyes
Those who left showed true sides
Yet within, my old self hides
Responsibilities stack, weight on my back
No cheat codes, just staying on track
Faces fade, memories stay
In the mirror, I see shades of gray

Through all the stress and also through the grind
Searching for peace of mind
World is not always so kind
In this chaos I'm always trying to find
The piece I left behind
That piece of me left behind

Even if the sky itself gets torn
I'll try to find my way home
Through the darkest times where hope is born
Even if I have to go it alone
Through the rain
Through the pain
Afterwards I've never been the same
It's hard to find the place where I belong
Since the man I was is gone

Even if the sky itself gets torn
I'll try to find my way home
Through the darkest times where hope is born
Even if I have to go it alone
Through the rain
Through the pain
Afterwards I've never been the same
It's hard to find the place where I belong
Since the man I was is gone

Even if the sky itself gets torn
I'll try to find my way home
Through the darkest times where hope is born
Even if I have to go it alone
Through the rain
Through the pain
Afterwards I've never been the same
It's hard to find the place where I belong
Since the man I was is gone
