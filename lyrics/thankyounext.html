        Oh, we all want a heart
Yeah, a real clich√©
But nah, let's just keep it cool
Push love away
We're all just so tough
No feelings to find
Just a hit and run
Leave the mess behind

We're just fine, thanks
Don't need a soul
Love's overrated
We're in full control
One night of fun
Then we're out the door
Why stick around?
That's such a bore

We all want to be in love
But who needs the pain?
Let's stick to the lies
Play this silly game
One night stands
Oh, so thrilling
We call it love
But who are we kidding?

In the nightlife glow
We chase the fake
In the morning light
Our heads ache
Who needs the truth
When you've got the show?
We're masters of disguise
Don't you know?

We're just fine, thanks
Don't need a soul
Love's overrated
We're in full control
One night of fun
Then we're out the door
Why stick around?
That's such a bore

We all want to be in love
But who needs the pain?
Let's stick to the lies
Play this silly game
One night stands
Oh, so thrilling
We call it love
But who are we kidding?

In the nightlife glow
We chase the fake
In the morning light
Our heads ache
Who needs the truth
When you've got the show?
We're masters of disguise
Don't you know?

We're just fine, thanks
Don't need a soul
Love's overrated
We're in full control
One night of fun
Then we're out the door
Why stick around?
That's such a bore

We all want to be in love
But who needs the pain?
Let's stick to the lies
Play this silly game
One night stands
Oh, so thrilling
We call it love
But who are we kidding?

Oh, what if we dared?
Ha, what a joke
To break down the walls
Just up in smoke
Find something real?
Nah, not for me
Let's keep it shallow
Keep it carefree

We all want to be in love
But who needs the pain?
Let's stick to the lies
Play this silly game
One night stands
Oh, so thrilling
We call it love
But who are we kidding?

In the end, we're all the same
Masters of this loveless game
Wearing disguise
Oh, so bold
Love's for suckers
Or so we're told
