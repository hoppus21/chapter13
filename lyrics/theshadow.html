      <p>
        I have to be
Blind not to see
That you are trying to get to me
Or maybe I'm
Too scared to find
That you are only one step behind

Nowhere to hide
No will to fight
I cannot do this every night
I have to find you
But I'm blind, yeah
Yeah, I am blind
(I am blind)

I can feel you there
I can feel you breathe
I can tell that you've found a way into my head
It's like you're next to me
I can't find voice to scream
I hope it's only a dream

I can't find grace
In this sad place
Feeling your presence in this maze
I keep looking down
But here around
There's no place that you cannot find

I have to be
Blind not to see
That you are trying to get to me
Or maybe I'm
Too scared to find that
You're behind
(You're behind)

I can feel you there
I can feel you breathe
I can tell that you've found a way into my head
It's like you're next to me
I can't find voice to scream
I hope it's only

Only a dream
Only a dream
Only a dream

I can feel you there
I can feel you breathe
I can tell that you've found a way into my head
It's like you're next to me
I can't find voice to scream
I hope it's only a dream
Only a dream
